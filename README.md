# My-Movie-s-Collection
Simple personal movie's collection using API


This is a web app I've been working on for my portfolio.

The idea is that the user can add the movies to their personal list,add comments to each movie, add review, create new lists and discuss with other users.

This webapp will have only 3 pages. The home screeen where the user will be presented with a list of current popular movies. The dashboard where the user will be able to check their own list of movies, how many movies were added, different categories, how many comments they have made, other user's activities etc.. The login page.

For now I have only created the home page, there are still some details to fix in the home page, but I will be working on it every day and will try to update here on a daily basis.
